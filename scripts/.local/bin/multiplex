# Take up to last 4 URLs copied to clipboard and display them all in minimal browser
# windows on same desktop space. Mainly for watching multiple NBA streams at once when
# https://github.com/plt3/NBARedZone isn't working. Highly recommended to assign to
# a keyboard shortcut via Karabiner-Elements
#
# NOTE: requires yabai to tile windows, Brave to open URLs (should be able to adapt for
# any Chromium browser though), and Maccy to get clipboard history (can adapt to read
# URLs from text file, etc. if don't want to use Maccy)

# Also recommended to use a browser extension to maximize a video within a window, like
# https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fullscreen-anything/olcfgpmjldkkjdclidhcbonieibfhhdh
# to avoid having to zoom each video manually
